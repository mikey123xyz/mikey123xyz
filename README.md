**'Digital Craftsman (Developer/Creator)'**

I'm an entry level full-stack developer who likes to help people with their projects and is building my version of the digital world that we all live in today. As a third year in college studying Computer Science I am ready to join the jobforce and get started in my career as a developer. All my projects and ideas are built from the ground up and will mainly be for solving real-life problems with code and make specific things a lot easier to use. In my freetime I like to edit videos and research things that I find interesting.
