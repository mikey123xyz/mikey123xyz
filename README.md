**'Digital Craftsman (Developer/Creator)'**

I'm an entry level full-stack developer who likes to help people with their projects and is building my version of the digital world that we all live in today. All my projects and ideas are built from the ground up and will mainly be for solving real-life problems with code and make specific things a lot easier to use. In my freetime I like to edit videos and research things that I find interesting.
